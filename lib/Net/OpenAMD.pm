=head1 NAME

Net::OpenAMD - Perl interface to the OpenAMD API


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Net::OpenAMD version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::OpenAMD;

    my $amd = Net::OpenAMD->new();

    my $location = $amd->location({ area => 'Engressia' });

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is to make it easy to grab information from the OpenAMD project at
The Next Hope.

http://wiki.hope.net/Attendee_Meta-Data

http://amd.hope.net/

http://amd.hope.net/2010/05/openamd-api-released-v1-1-1/

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 new

Create a new object for accessing the OpenAMD API.

    my $amd = Net::OpenAMD->new( $options );

$options is a hashref with configuration options.

Current options are 

=over

=item base_uri

A URL to the API, currently defaults to https://api.hope.net/api/

Most likely it should end with a / to make URI happy, so notice that if you
having 404 errors you don't expect.

=item ua

Should be a pre-configured LWP::UserAgent or similar that returns a
HTTP::Response object when its get method is called with a URI.

=back

=head2 get

This is the main method, although probably never used.  It has better/easier
ways to access the different actions of the API.

    my $data = $amd->get( $action, $params );

$params are anything that are supported by URI->query, they will get passed
on the request.

Here $data is a the JSON returned by the API converted to Perl reference.

Helper methods you can call as $amd->method($params) are:

=over

=item interests

=item location

=item new

=item speakers

=item stats

=item talks

=item users

=back

Unless specified, there is nothing different about any of the helper methods
than just calling get($action) instead.  Depending on API changes, this may
not always be the case.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

All methods should croak when an error occurs.  
If the remote API returns a successful response that contains valid JSON, that
will be decoded and returned.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Net::OpenAMD requires no configuration files or environment variables.

Net::OpenAMD uses LWP::UserAgent for requests and environment for that is
not cleared.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=head3 L<LWP::UserAgent>

=head3 L<URI>

=head3 L<Net::OAuth>

=head3 L<JSON::Any>


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

=over 

=item Currently it does not support the OAuth that is required to log into the
API and get information.  

=back

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-net-openamd@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
